 * This contract implements the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern,

 * for the implementation address.
 *
 * The contract uses OpenZeppelin's upgradeable patterns:
 * - Initializable: For one-time initialization instead of constructors
 * - UUPSUpgradeable: For upgrade functionality
 * - OwnableUpgradeable: For access control (owner can authorize upgrades)

 * @custom:security-contact security@cloutcards.io
