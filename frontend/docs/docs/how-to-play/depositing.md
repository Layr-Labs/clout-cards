# Depositing Funds

Before you can join a table, you need to deposit ETH into your escrow balance.

## How Deposits Work

1. You send ETH to the Clout Cards smart contract
2. The contract credits your **escrow balance**
3. You can use your escrow balance to buy in at any table
4. Your escrow balance is tracked on-chain

## Making a Deposit

1. Go to your **Profile** page
2. Click the **"Deposit"** button
3. Enter the amount of ETH you want to deposit
4. Click **"Deposit"** and confirm the transaction in your wallet

!!! info "Transaction Confirmation"
    After submitting, wait for the transaction to be confirmed on Base Sepolia. Your balance will update automatically once confirmed.

## Deposit Limits

| Limit | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Minimum | 0.001 ETH |
| Maximum | No limit |

## Understanding Your Balance

Your **escrow balance** is separate from your **table balance**:

- **Escrow Balance**: Funds held in the smart contract, available for buying into tables
- **Table Balance**: Funds currently at a poker table (your chip stack)

When you stand up from a table, your table balance is returned to your escrow balance.
