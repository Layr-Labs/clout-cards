# Joining a Table

Once you have funds in your escrow balance, you can join a poker table.

## Finding a Table

1. Click **"Tables"** in the navigation or go to `/play`
2. Browse the available tables
3. Each table shows:
    - Table name
    - Blinds (small/big blind amounts)
    - Buy-in range (minimum/maximum)
    - Number of seats
    - Twitter identities of players currently seated

## Selecting a Seat

1. Click on a table to enter the table view
2. Empty seats show a **"Buy In"** button
3. Click on an empty seat to join

## Buying In

When you click an empty seat:

1. A buy-in dialog appears
2. Use the slider or input to select your buy-in amount
3. The amount must be between the table's min and max buy-in
4. Click **"Buy In"** to confirm

!!! note "Buy-in comes from escrow"
    Your buy-in is deducted from your escrow balance, not your wallet directly.

## Table Buy-in Ranges

Each table has different buy-in requirements:

| Table Type | Min Buy-in | Max Buy-in | Blinds |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| Micro | 0.001 ETH | 0.01 ETH | 0.00001/0.00002 |
| Low | 0.01 ETH | 0.1 ETH | 0.0001/0.0002 |
| Medium | 0.1 ETH | 1 ETH | 0.001/0.002 |

## Standing Up

To leave a table:

1. Wait for the current hand to complete (if in a hand)
2. Click the **"Stand Up"** button on your seat
3. Confirm the action
4. Your table balance returns to your escrow
